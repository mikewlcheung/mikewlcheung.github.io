# Workshops
* I will give a two-day workshop on [multilevel modeling and structural equation modeling with R](http://hkuems1.hku.hk/hkuems/ec_hdetail.aspx?guest=Y&UEID=38537) at [the Department of Social Work & Social Administration](http://www.socialwork.hku.hk/), HKU in August 2015.

* I will give a two-day workshop on [introduction to meta-analysis using structural equation modeling](http://www.uv.uio.no/cemo/english/about/news-events-and-publications/events/2015-10-06-workshop-meta-analytic-structural-equation-modeling.html) at [the Centre for Educational Measurement](http://www.uv.uio.no/cemo/english/) and [the Department of Special Needs Education](https://www.uv.uio.no/isp/english/), University of Oslo, Norway in October 2015 .
