* I will give a three-day workshop on *Structural Equation Modeling* at [the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy](http://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/), NUS in August 2015 .

* I will give a two-day workshop on [Introduction to Meta-Analysis using Structural Equation Modeling](http://www.uv.uio.no/cemo/english/about/news-events-and-publications/events/2015-10-06-workshop-meta-analytic-structural-equation-modeling.html) at [the Centre for Educational Measurement](http://www.uv.uio.no/cemo/english/) and [the Department of Special Needs Education](https://www.uv.uio.no/isp/english/), University of Oslo, Norway in October 2015 .
