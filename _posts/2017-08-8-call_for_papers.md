# Big Data in Psychology: Methods and Applications
## [A Special Issue of the Zeitschrift für Psychologie](https://conferences.leibniz-psychology.org/index.php/bigdata/bigdata2018/schedConf/cfp)

**Guest Editors**: [Mike W.-L. Cheung](http://mikewlcheung.github.io/) and [Suzanne Jak](http://www.suzannejak.nl/)

An associated conference will take place at ZPID - [Leibniz-Institute for Psychology Information in Trier](http://bigdata2018.leibniz-psychology.org), Germany, on **June 7-9, 2018**.

## Focus of the Special Issue, Aims, and Scope

The availability of Big Data is more and more common in many fields including business, computer science, government, social and behavioral sciences, and psychology. Since it is hard to clearly define what Big Data is, we do not impose a strict definition of Big Data in this special issue.

There are three key characteristics that may qualify data as Big Data, namely Volume, Velocity, and Variety. High-volume data refers to the size of the dataset is too large that may lead to problems with storage and analysis. High-velocity data means that the data come at a high rate and/or have to be processed within a short period of time (e.g., real-time and interactive processing). High-variety data are data consisting of many types of structured and unstructured data with a mix of text, pictures, videos, and numbers. Another characteristic for Big Data is the veracity, which indicates the importance of the quality (or truthfulness) of data. Some examples of Big Data that may be relevant for Psychology are social media data, health/physiological tracker data, geolocation data, dynamic public records, travel route data, behavioral and genetic data. Papers submitted to this special issue may focus on one or more of these features in Big Data.

The overall aim of this special issue is to address methods and applications using Big Data in Psychology. The topics covered may address (but are not limited to):

* Methodological and statistical issues in collecting, handling, processing, and analyzing Big Data in psychology.

* Applications and illustrations of how Big Data are used to address psychological research questions.

* Psychological interventions making use of Big Data.

* Inference models taking Big Data into account.

* Comparison of Big Data versus ´traditional´ data sources (e.g., self-reports, peer-reports, etc.).

* Combining traditional data sources with Big Data.

* Implications of Big Data for research infrastructures in psychology and related areas.


## How to Submit

There is a two-stage submissions process. Initially, interested authors are requested to submit extended abstracts of their proposed papers. Authors of the selected abstracts

will then be invited to submit full papers. All papers will undergo blind peer review.

### Stage 1: Structured Abstract Submission

Authors interested in this special issue must submit a structured abstract of the planned manuscript before submitting a full paper. The goal is to provide authors with prompt feedback regarding the suitability and relevance of the planned manuscript to the special issue.

The deadline for submitting structured abstracts is **November 15, 2017**.

Feedback on whether or not the editors encourage authors to submit a full paper will be given by December 15, 2017.

*Submission guidelines for structured abstracts:*

Structured abstracts should be within four pages and may encompass information on each of the following headings: (a) Background, (b) Objectives, (c) Research

question(s) and/or hypothesis/es, (d) Method/Approach, (e) Results/Findings, (f) Conclusions and implications (expected).

Structured abstracts should be submitted by e-mail to both guest editors at mikewlcheung@nus.edu.sg and S.Jak@uva.nl.

There will be an international conference on “Big Data in Psychology: Methods and Applications” on June 7-9, 2018 at ZPID - Leibniz-Institute for Psychology Information in Trier, Germany. Authors who are encouraged to submit a full paper will be invited to present their manuscripts at the conference. Further information about the conference can be found here:

### Stage 2: Full Paper Submission

For those who have been encouraged to submit a full paper, the deadline for submission of manuscripts is February 28, 2018.

Full manuscripts will undergo a blind peer-review process.

Submission guidelines for full papers:

Maximum 8,500 words (approx. 60,000 characters, including spaces) in 12-point Times New Roman font, formatted in APA style (http://www.apastyle.org/), A4 paper format, 1-inch margins. Figures should be in grayscale only.

The title page should contain title, authors, and affiliations, including a complete address for correspondence (including e-mail address). An abstract of 150 words or less and a list of up to five keywords should follow the title page.

pages or at the end of the text.
