## Thesis topics that I may supervise
My research area is [quantitative psychology](http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/index.aspx)--the statistical modeling of psychological data. A related area is [psychometrics](https://www.psychometricsociety.org/content/what-psychometrics). 

### Sample thesis topics I have supervised
* Do we know why people stay? A meta-analysis of job embeddedness and turnover
* Only the hottest need apply: A meta-analysis investigating the effects of lookism on evaluative workplace outcomes
* A simulation study on the boundary conditions of fitting the Thurstonian IRT model to forced-choice data
