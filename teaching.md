## Thesis topics that I may supervise
My research area is [quantitative psychology](http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/index.aspx)--the statistical modeling of psychological data. A related area is [psychometrics](https://www.psychometricsociety.org/content/what-psychometrics). You may get familiar with the area of quantitative psychology by reading a few recent issues in the following journals.

* [Behavior Research Methods](http://www.springer.com/psychology/cognitive+psychology/journal/13428)
* [British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)2044-8317)
